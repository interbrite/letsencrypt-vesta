# AUTOMATE LET'S ENCRYPT CERTIFICATE INSTALLATION FOR VESTACP
#
# Copyright (C) 2015 Jason R. Pitoniak.
# This code is licensed under the MIT License.  See the LICENSE.md
# file for details.
#
# This script automates the process of requesting SSL certs through
# Let's Encrypt for VestaCP sites.  Certificates are requested with
# the primary domain as the certificate common name (CN) and all
# aliases on the domain as subject-alternate names (SAN).  The
# account owner's email address is used as the contact email sent
# with the certificate request.
#
# This script requires a working VestaCP installation and the
# separate installation of the Let's Encrypt ACME client.  See the
# README.md file for more information and installation instructions.

###### SETUP ######

# You probably won't need to change anything here unless you have
# an atypical setup or you wish to change the options used with
# the Let's Encrypt client.  If your Linux distro has a Let's
# Encrypt package available, change the LETSENCRYPT_COMMAND to
# reflect its location.

#Set the command that should be used to run the letsencrypt tool
#Include any arguments that should be used by default
#(arguments shouldn't be necessary if using /etc/letsencrypt/cli.ini)
#The -m (mail) and -d (domain) options will be added automatically
LETSENCRYPT_COMMAND='/usr/local/letsencrypt/letsencrypt-auto 
    -t --renew-by-default --agree-tos --webroot -w /etc/letsencrypt/webroot
    --server https://acme-v01.api.letsencrypt.org/directory'

#Set the path to Vesta's installation base
#(you probably won't need to cahnge this)
VESTA_PATH='/usr/local/vesta'

# Don't change anything below this line
